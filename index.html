								<!-- <p>Hey there, I'm Yani. A.K.A. Nini, Yans, Yippym... the list goes on. I identify as a female alongside an odd 4 billion people in the world. I may be insignificant in the lives of many, but I strive to be of value to those around me.</p>
								<p>As a Chinese-Canadian, I face the dilemma of finding common ground. For the longest time, I assimilated myself into the Western culture because I was embarrassed to exhibit my Chinese blood. I remember pretending I didn't understand Mandarin when my parents pulled me away from my European classmates. I would scarf down my homemade dumplings during lunchtime because I admired those with a single slice of baloney slapped between two pieces of wonder white bread. Looking back, I chuckle at my foolish attempts to become something I am not.</p>
								<p>I currently reside in my hometown, Toronto, Ontario. After numerous relationship transformations with myself, I have come to appreciate and embrace Chinese culture. Throughout the ongoing process of finding myself, a paramount domain has accompanied me: technology.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>It started as a guilty pleasure - sneaking my phone into bed to catch up on the latest episode of “Nirvana in Fire”, a Chinese Television show. This quickly turned into the eagerness to learn filmmaking and animation. However, it was never fulfilling enough. I had a strong desire to reveal the underlying mechanisms supporting each application.</p>
								<p>So I set my mind to learning streams of software development. I began attending hackathons, where I cultivated both web and mobile development skills, enrolled in the renowned CS50, worked in a start-up, and began personal projects. A few months passed, and I realized this wasn’t what I was searching for. I didn't want to sit in front of thousands of lines of code and search for bugs. Nonetheless, this experience directed me to my current pursuance; the grey area, the connection between users and applications.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Being able to adapt to new environments is an essential skill. With the world around us evolving at an unthinkable speed, it's important to slow down and explore different pathways. And who knows, maybe I'll go back to the development side of things.</p>
								<p>Welp, that's me in a nutshell. Check out my past and present pursuits <a href="#experience">here</a>!</p> -->
